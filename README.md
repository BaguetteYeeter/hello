# Hello world!

This is a repository where I'll basically learn C

I'll add a bunch of things to this repo over time, like makefiles, autotools, locales, and other cool stuff

This whole repo is for learning, good software will come later

## Installation

```bash
$ gcc hello.c -o hello
$ ./hello
```
